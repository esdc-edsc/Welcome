# Recommendation: Use Git Based Collaborative Development Environment

A collaborative development environment (CDE) is an online space where a software development project's stakeholders can work together to discuss, document, and produce project deliverables. Common features of Git based CDE's include: 
* Git based version control system 
* Pull/merge request for Git branches
* Bug, Issue, Work Item tracking system
* Documentation management system
* Discussion forums
* User Access Management
* Integrated Automated Build, Test and Deployment functionality.


## Benefits

* Allows software development teams and stakeholders to centralize all related work and communications related to a specific software project/product.
* Git based CDE's often include functionality to create and link source code branches to Bug, Issue or Work Items which can help developers to [work with smaller changes and short lived branches](#). This functionality improves  auditability of changes to the software. *TODO: add links or refrences to any audit/release control points that are addressed*
* Git based CDE's Pull/merge request functionality can be used to [implement Pull Request Code Review](#) practices.
* CDE's can be used to [implement automated builds and tests on code check-in/commits](#) that enable faster feedback for developers allowing them to address issues sooner in the development process.
* For security and auditing purposes CDE User Access Management features enable greater control and traceability of changes to software source code. *TODO: add links or refrences to any audit/release control points that are addressed*
