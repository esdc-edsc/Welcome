## Working Model

Currently the intake process involves reaching out to the SA group by email with a brief explanation/context. Once received, we will reach out for more information. 

The departmental priorities guide the prioritization of tasks handled by the team. Tasks and deliverables with greater urgency are given greater attention by the SA team.
