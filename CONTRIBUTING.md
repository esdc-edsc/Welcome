## How to Contribute

When contributing, post comments and discuss changes you wish to make via Issues.

Feel free to propose changes by creating Pull Requests. If you don't have write access, editing a file will create a Fork of this project for you to save your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to a file will write it to a new Branch in your Fork, so you can send a Pull Request.

If this is your first time contributing on GitHub, don't worry! Let us know if you have any questions.

### Recommendations and Guides

The “Welcome” project in ESDC org (master branch) used to publish recommendations and guides (how to).
Draft documents can be created either in a branch in ESDC or a branch in the Fork on DevCoP (prefix with `draft-`).
Initial draft doesn’t require review, but any changes to the draft require review via a PR.
The publish of the doc will also have a final review via a PR.
